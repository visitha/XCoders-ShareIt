			<b>Purpose of this application :</b>
		</h2>
		</br>
		<h3>There are thousands of people dying because of hunger.
			Millions of people do not have enough food leading to unhealthy
			lives. On the other hand, there are many food dumping happening
			because of excess. The main reason for food waste is this excess.
			When one party is badly in need of food, the other party is throwing
			away the food. This application helps to eliminate that gap by
			providing a platform for buyers/ refugees and sellers/ donators to
			meet.</h3>
		</br>
		<h3>
			<b>Our primary purpose of this application is to give a solution
				for huge food waste in World.</b>
		</h3>
		<h3>
			&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp; People who have
			excess of food can create a "Donate Case" with details of the item
			he/she has. (Donator can also be a seller, but we selected the word
			Donator as he will be selling at a lower price than the ordinary
			sellers, as explained below) Then people who need those donations can
			contact them and make arrangements to ship the items to his/her
			location/country.
			</h4>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b>Our secondary purpose of this application is to give a
					solution for huge market prices of food items</b>
			</h3>
			<h3>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;In certain
				locations/countries, food prices are very high. The reasons being
				the lack of competition among sellers giving them control over
				prices and having many other intermediate parties between the buyer
				and seller. This application enables direct contact among
				buyers/sellers creating a competitive market for sellers. This helps
				to put down the prices of food items.This is why we consider seller
				as a donator! If you need to give the excess items free of charge,
				you are more than welcome to do so! And you should now be able to
				correctly guess why other party is called refugee.</h3>

			<h3>
				<b>Donators can login to the system and create a Donate case</b>
			</h3>
			<h3>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;When a
				donator logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the
				cases made by refugees. He/She can also view other cases using the
				Search option provided by the application.</h3>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b>Refugees can login to the system and create a Refugee case</b>
			</h3>
			<h3>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;When a
				refugee logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the
				cases made by donators. He/She can also view other cases using the
				Search option provided by the application.</h3>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b>Transporters can login to the system and view settled cases
					in order to provide transportation</b>
			</h3>
			<h3>&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;When there
				are both a refugee and a donator for a particular case, it is needed
				to transport the items from seller to the buyer. Transporters are
				the intermediate party which does this.</h3>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b>Plans for the future</b>
			</h3>
			<h3>We hope to incorporate a bidding system to items to make the
				market competitive for both parties. This will enable buyers to bid
				for items so that sellers can select a suitable bidder.</h3>
			<h3>Furthermore we will make it easier to users by adding a push
				notification system to which users can subscribe and get to know
				about new things happening at ShareIt as soon as they happen..!</h3>
			<h3>Give capability do transactions via "ShareIt" application.</h3>
			<h3>Add Google Map API to display Geo locations of all share cases and users.</h3>
