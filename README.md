# XCoders ShareIt

##This is the project by XCoders for the Koding Hackathon, first ever virtual hackathon! (https://koding.com/Hackathon)

##### We selected the Theme #1, Problems facing our planet. Under this theme,  we selected Food/Water waste. Going by the theme we decided to create an application whereby users can submit details about excess food, water, etc they have so that interested parties can get to know about those. This is because, excess is what eventually becomes waste!

### Purpose of this application :
There are thousands of people dying because of hunger. Millions of people do not have enough food leading to unhealthy lives. On the other hand, there are many food dumping happening because of excess. The main reason for food waste is this excess. When one party is badly in need of food, the other party is throwing away the food. This application helps to eliminate that gap by providing a platform for buyers/ refugees and sellers/ donators to meet.  

### Our primary purpose of this application is to give a solution for huge food waste in the World.
People who have excess of food can create a “Donate Case” with details of the item he/she has. Then people who need those donations can contact them and make arrangements to ship the items to his/her location/country. Similarly refugees(or people on behalf of them) can add posts about their needs so that Donators can view them and lend a helping hand. For those who have items with intention of selling, they too can publish about their goods so that interested buyers can view them.

### Our secondary purpose of this application is to give a solution for high market prices of food items

In certain locations/countries, food prices are very high. The reasons being the lack of competition among sellers giving them control over prices and having many other intermediate parties between the buyer and seller. This application enables direct contact among buyers/sellers creating a competitive market for sellers. This helps to put down the prices of food items.

#### Donators can login to the system and create a Donate case
When a donator logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the cases made by refugees. He/She can also view other cases using the Search option provided by the application.

#### Refugees can login to the system and create a Refugee case
When a refugee logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the cases made by donators. He/She can also view other cases using the Search option provided by the application.

#### Sellers can login to the system and create a case
When a seller logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the cases made by buyers. He/She can also view other cases using the Search option provided by the application.

#### Buyers can login to the system and view cases
When a buyer logs into the system, by default he/she will be shown the cases made by sellers. He/She can also view other cases using the Search option provided by the application.
